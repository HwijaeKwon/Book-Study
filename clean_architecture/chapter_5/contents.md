# Object oriented programming
## The power of polymorphism
- Easy to deal with changes.

## Dependency inversion
- The source code dependency points in the opposite direction compared to the flow of control.
- Any source code dependency, no matter where it is, can be inverted. -> Provide safe and convenient polymorphism
- Absolute control over the direction of all source code dependencies in the system.
- Independent deployability
- Independent developability

## Conclusion
- Object-Oriented is the ability, through the use of polymorphism, to gain absolute control over every source code dependency in the system.
