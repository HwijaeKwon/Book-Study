# Starting with the bricks: Programming paradigms
- Paradigms are ways of programming, relatively unrelated to languages.

# Paradigm overview
- Structured programming : discipline on direct transfer of control
- Object oriented programming : discipline on indirect transfer of control
- Functional programming : discipline upon assignment
- The paradigms tell us what not to do, more than they tell us what to do.
