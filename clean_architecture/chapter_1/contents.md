# Chapter1. What is Design and Architecture?
## The Goal?
- The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resource required to build and maintain the required system.

## Key points
- Developers buy into a familiar lie: "We can clean it up later; we just have to get to market first!" Of course, things never do get cleaned up later.
- Making messes is always slower than staying clean, no matter which tiem scale you are using.
- The only way to go fast, is to go well.
