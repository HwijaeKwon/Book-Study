# What Is Architecture?
- The division of the system into components, the arrangement of those components, and the ways in which those components communicate with each other.
- Purpose : facilitate the development, deployment, operation, and maintenance of the software system
- However, the architecture of a system has very little bearing on whether that system works.
- Supporting behavior : passive and cosmetic, not active or essential

## Development
- Architecture should make the system easy to develop
- Small team : architecture seems like impediment at first
- Many team : component-per-team architecture, no time

## Deployment
- Architecture should make the system easy to deploy with a single action
- Had the architects considered deployment issues early on

## Operation

## Maintenance

## Keeping Options Open
- The way to keep software soft is to leave as many options open as possible, for as long as possible.
- The goal of the architect is to create a shape for the system that recognizes policy as the most essential element of the system while making the details irrelevant to that policy.

 ## Device Independence
