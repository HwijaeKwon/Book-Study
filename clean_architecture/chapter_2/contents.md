# A Tale of Two Values
## Two values
- Behavior : Make things to do specific behavior
  - function
  - urgent, rarely important
- Architecture : Should be as shape agnostic
  - important, rarely urgent
- Behavior < Architecture

## Fight for the Architecture
- Struggle! Fight!
- You(developer) have a stake in the software that you need to safeguard. That's part of your role. and part of your duty.
- If architecture comes last, them the system will become ever more costly to develop, and eventually change will become practically impossible for part or all of the system.


## Key points
- It is the responsibility of the software developer to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency of features.
