# Structured programming
- Impose disipline on direct tranfer of control.
- Nowadays we are all structured programmers.
- Functional decomposition!
  - smallest function to the largest component
  - falsifiable (testable)

## Functional decomposition
- Programmers could break down large proposed systems into modules and components that could be further broken down into tiny provable functions.

## No formal proofs
- Fow of today's programmers believe that formal proofs are an appropriate way to produce high-quality software.

## Science to the rescue
- Science is the discipline of proving provable statements false.

## Tests
- Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs.
- Software is like a science.
