# Objects and Data Structures
## Data Abstraction
## Data/Object Anti-Symmetry
- object: hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data
- data structure : expose their data and have no meaningful functions
- Procedual code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structures.
- OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions.

## The Law of Demeter
- A module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates.
