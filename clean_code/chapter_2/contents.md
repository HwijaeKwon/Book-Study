# Meaningful Names
## Use Intention-Revealing Names
- Intention!!!
- Q. What if the name should be related to business?

## Avoid Disinformation
- accountList < accounts (list means something specific to programmers)
- Beware of using names which vary in small ways.
- Spelling similar concepts similarly is information.
- Q. Does the length of the variable not matter?

## Make Meaningful Distinctions
- If name must be different, then they should also mean something different.
- Info, Data -> reflect on myself...
