# Functions
## Small
- Functions should be small.

## Blocks and indenting
- Blocks within if, else, while, and so on statements should be one line long.
  - In block -> one function with nice name
 
## Do One Thing 
- Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.
- How to define one thing?
  - If a function does only those steps that are one level below the stated name of the function, then the function is doing one thing.
  - A function is doing more than one thing if you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its implementation.
